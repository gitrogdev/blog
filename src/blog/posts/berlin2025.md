In a Fast German Car - Radiohead in Berlin

The moment I'd been waiting my whole semester for: Radiohead in Berlin. I bought this ticket in the presale back in September, considered selling it when I bought the Bologna tickets, didn't, and talked to my professors to make sure I had all the work I needed done for this Monday (the last day of classes before finals week) so I could go to the concert unhindered. And finally, I was going. I went to Berlin by FlixBus, which was a fourteen hour bus, but thankfully it was direct. The bus stopped in Maribor, Graz, Vienna, Prague, and Dresden, so at least the route was scenic. On the way there, I watched the first part of Stranger Things 5, which had just come out at the time. It was pretty good, I won't go into spoilers here or anything, since this isn't a Stranger Things review, but I definitely liked the first half of the season.

Getting to Berlin, I immediately went to my friend's apartment, napped for a few hours, then went to a Christmas church service with him, because that was happening in early December for whatever reason. I wore one of my Radiohead shirts, being there for the concert, and a German guy probably twenty years my senior started nerding out with me about how good *Kid A* was for ten minutes. Nice. After that, some of the people my age asked me to hang out after, so I went with them. They made us lunch, we played *Poetry for Neanderthals*, a card game made by the same people who made *Exploding Kittens*, which I absolutely crushed at, by the way. After that, the girls wanted to watch *K-Pop: Demon Hunters*, which was fine, not really my cup of tea but I was able to enjoy it, although definitely not as much as the others did. Went back to my friend's apartment, picked up some döner, because when in Berlin..., and went to bed.

Monday. Concert day. Got up and decided to spend the day exploring Berlin, since doors didn't open to the concert until 18:00, and I had a seat assignment, so it wasn't like I needed to get there early to get a good spot. First, being a Masshole away from Boston so long, I got some Dunkies, because they have that in Berlin. After that, I went to Tempelhofer Feld, which is a former West German airport that has since been turned into a park, with the runways and taxi ways serving as bike and walking trails. That was really cool, especially as someone who's into aviation. After that, I took the U-Bahn to Checkpoint Charlie, got my pictures there, and grabbed a bite to eat at [frittenwerk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fNARpwVwBDK8wCBh7), a french fry restaurant where I got really good currywurst. From there, I went to explore the city. I walked to the Führerbunker, which is now just a parking lot for some apartment buildings with a small sign showing a map of the bunker's previous layout, from there I went to the Holocaust Memorial, the American Embassy, Brandenburger Tor, and onto the Reichstag. Outside the Reichstag, two Radiohead fans from Australia, who were also going to the show that night, noticed my *Hail to the Thief* shirt, and we nerded out about the band for a bit, and got some selfies together (on one of their phones, so I don't have them).

After that, from the Reichstag I walked all the way to Uber Arena, which is about a six kilometer (three and a half mile) walk. I walked down Unter den Linden to Karl-Marx-Allee, seeing all the sights on the way, taking plenty of pickers along the way, including the Berliner Dom, the Berlin TV Tower, and Alexanderplatz. I ended up getting to Uber Arena about three hours early, and there were already massive queues for the entrance (Unipol Arena in Bologna had several entrances all around, and different sectors were allotted different entrances, but Uber Arena only had the one for general entry.) There was also an even longer queue for the merch stand, because they only had one open before the show. I met a buddy who's generally wicked busy and I never get to see at an [Irish Pub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NgtLgz7hNLxhi4u37) right ouside the arena, which was really cool to get to catch up with him.

After that, it was time for the show. The show I'd been waiting the entire semester for. The show I signed up in order to even apply to get tickets to. The show I waited in the Eventim queue to get the tickets to, and fought with their user interface to actually buy. By that point, the queue outside was massive, and it was raining, so we were all getting poured on. As I waited in the raindrops, I put on *Sit Down. Stand Up.* Eventually, I got in, waited in another queue to leave my rain-drenched coat at the coat check, and made my way to my seat. I had a much better seat than last time, being in Section 201 of Uber Arena, I would actually see the faces of the band members. I was sitting next to a couple from Paris, who I nerded out with about the band for a bit, before a woman came to sit next to me and asked me if I was there alone. I was, and she explained that she came with a friend, who was sitting a five rows up, and asked if I'd be willing to sit with her. So I ended up getting an even better seat, advancing five rows closer to the front. Doing a good thing has never felt so rewarding. They did the same soundcheck light and tone thing they did in Bologna, and the band took stage. 

The setlist was largely the same as Bologna, but it was a way different experience being that much closer to the band. I was also a lot more comfortable at this one, and actually had had a good's night sleep the night before, so I had a lot more energy. The whole row in front of me was basically completely empty, and after a few songs, a girl two rows in front of me climbed into the empty row so she had more space to dance. After a few more songs, I decided to do the same thing. I don't know why that row was empty, but I certainly wasn't complaining, and if I had to guess I'd say those were the Section 201 tickets scalpers were attempting to sell for €1,200. The whole tour was functioning off of two core set lists, one for the even numbered nights in each city, and one for the odds. Since I was in show three in Bologna, and show one in Berlin, the set lists were essentially the same, but with three songs different. In Bologna, they played *Talk Show Host*, *How to Disappear Completely*, and *There, There*, and in Berlin, those were replaced with *Idioteque*, *All I Need*, and *Jigsaw Falling into Place*. Having more energy and being more comfortable, I was doing a lot more dancing and singing. Many songs I recorded, others I just put the phone down and danced, and for some I somehow did both. *Jigsaw Falling into Place* hit especially hard live, and while I knew I would definitely be kicking myself if I didn't record that, I physically could not stay still. *All I Need* was another surprise, which I initially thought was *Where I End and You Begin* when I heard the bass humming at the beginning, until I heard the second note, at which I felt a little disappointed, but that disappointment immediately vanished when I realized it was *All I Need*.

Once again, it was a setlist I really enjoyed. Not being in the back and being surrounded with more people though, I noticed more which songs were more popular. *Let Down*, *No Surprises*, and *Fake Plastic Trees* were fan favorites, no surprises there. *Weird Fishes / Arpeggi* and *Jigsaw Falling into Place* got the whole crowd up and moving, while *Bloom* also got much of the crowd moving, to the restroom. Disappointing, it's a really good song. I didn't notice during the show since I had Loop earbuds in, but I discovered after watching my recordings that the Dutch guy behind me was talking through a good chunk of *The Gloaming.* Guess he wasn't ready to get gloamed, glad it didn't bother me during the show. Another guy behind me yelled "YEAH!!!" when those first few notes of *The Gloaming* played though, so glad to hear there were other like-minded individuals near me. I think the same guy also yelled "ROCK 'N ROLL!!" just before they started *Jigsaw Falling into Place*. Legend. This time, in order to have less disjointed clips, I started recording before every song, and stopped recording if I decided I didn't feel like holding my phone up for the whole song. The full set list is listed below, and the songs I recorded in full, and uploaded to my YouTube channel, are in **bold**.

Overall, another great show. Thom's recent throat infection, which I was worried might affect the show, was noticeable in a couple songs where he sounded a bit out of breath, but the band was on point the whole time. Being the opening night in Berlin, the mixing was also a little off for the first couple songs, Thom was really quiet compared to the instruments, but they fixed this by *Sit Down. Stand Up.* Being closer to the stage, I could actually watch the band and appreciate all the members a lot more. But I got to see Radiohead live **again**, with much more energy, comfortability, and a better seat, so I truly have nothing to complain about. Getting out of the venue was much easier. I bought my merch and got my coat back from the coat drop off, which took about half an hour, and then, unlike Bologna, Berlin has reliable 24/7 public transport, so I was able to hop on the U-Bahn straight back to my buddy's apartment, with no need for a kind Italian to step in to my rescue. The next morning, I left Berlin, also by FlixBus, returning back to Zagreb for my final exams. The bus ended up breaking down in Prague for a few hours, turning my fourteen hour trip into a closer to seventeen hour one. Still, I made it back, with a phone full of videos, a head full of memories, and lungs full of influenza, which I picked up somewhere on my trip. Oh well, at least I didn't start feeling symptoms until I was already home.

Thank you to Thom, Jonny, Ed, Colin, Phil, Chris, and all who made this show possible. It was truly amazing. End of this tour, what's next? LP10? Another EU tour? A US tour? Whatever it is, I'll be there, climbing up the walls...
