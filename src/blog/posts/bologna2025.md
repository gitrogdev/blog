Attenzione! - Radiohead in Bologna
November 17th, 2025

First time in Bologna, first time seeing Radiohead live. Truly was an experience. I initially got myself a ticket to Berlin through the presale, but just one ticket to go alone. But I wanted to go with a friend, and I found out that two resale tickets to Bologna were cheaper than one to Berlin, so I went and bought them. Things didn't work out with that friend, so I invited a buddy from university who likes Radiohead, but isn't exactly a superfan. Still, we were both ready to enjoy the show, and both pretty excited. The bus from Zagreb to Bologna was about eight hours. Funnily enough, most of the other people taking an overnight Sunday-Monday bus from Zagreb to Bologna were also going to see Radiohead, who would have thought. I'm glad I was wearing my *Hail to the Thief* shirt, as it was a beacon to other Radiohead fans.

We got into Bologna around four in the morning, and the show was at six, so we had some time to kill. We saw some other people from Zagreb waiting at the bus station, also seemingly having no plans, so I went up and talked to them, despite my buddy's social anxiety preventing him from walking up to someone with similar interests and starting a conversation. I get where he's coming from though, teenage me would be completely appalled by that concept. Crazy, right? We ended up hanging out with them for a couple hours, grabbed some coffee, and parted ways.

My buddy and I then proceeded to explore the city, but it soon became apparent that both of us were wicked tired, as we had intended to sleep on the bus, and thought we were being smart and saving money by just getting two night bus tickets and no lodging, but the error of our ways was becoming very apparent. We got some breakfast and coffee at [Piano Piano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6zx58yG8q7cEJUEj8), which was really good, but insufficient to defeat our fatigue. Not wanting to be in this zombie-like state come Radiohead, we decided to find a hotel offering a day room, and managed to get three to four hours of sleep. That was enough to energize us enough for the rest of the day, and was definitely the right call. After that, being in Bologna, we had one mission: to find Bolognese. However, there were a couple slight hiccups in our plan. One: it was three o'clock, and in Italy, most restaurants close during the afternoon between lunch and dinner. And two: my buddy is a Bosnian Muslim. Bolognese sauce is not halal. So, we had to find a restaurant that a): was open and b): had good options for my Muslim friend.

We eventually found one that looked pretty good, [Osteria Da Fortunata](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zenqKkJZ1xGLFTLd7). It was obviously a tourist trap, they were making fresh pasta right in the window, their menu was in a dozen different languages (including American English, represented by the Betsy Ross flag), and contained AI-generated art. But, it was open, and it smelled good, so we went for it. But after we ordered our drinks and moved on to ordering, we learned that they were out of the Bolognese sauce! The pasta we did end up ordering was still very good, and the Tiramisu afterwards was some of the best I've had, but we did fail in our mission of acquiring Bolognese in Bologna.

After that, we made our way to the show. We bought a train ticket to Unipol Arena, which isn't actually in the city of Bologna, but a small town just outside of it. However, the train was so full it was delayed in departing by fifteen minutes because so many people were on the train that the automatic doors would not close, and there were hundreds more of us trying to get on. They redirected us to a bus, which they told us would accept the train ticket, but no, they did not, we had to pay an additional €10 for the bus ticket. We all packt like sardines into the bus, and eventually set off for Unipol Arena. We ended up arriving half an hour late, which wasn't a problem, since we had seats, and the band still didn't take stage for another two hours.

After getting into the arena, buying our overpriced drinks and popcorn, and taking our seats, we waited for a bit for the band to take stage. It turned out our seats were all the way in the corner in the very back row. Oh well, at least we had a good view. Doors opened at 6:00, but the band wouldn't take stage until 8:30, and we took our seats at 6:45. While we waited, they played songs from various artists, Italian and international, not seemingly having much relation to Radiohead. Once the lights turned off, the screens in the middle began their sound check, playing tones and shining lights into different sectors of the room, as the people in that sector would jump up and cheer. After a bit of that, the band finally took stage, and opened the concert with *Planet Telex*.

I couldn't believe it, I was finally getting to hear Radiohead live. Just three months before, I thought I had gotten into their music too late, that I would never get to hear them, I had missed my shot. But here I was, rocking out to *Planet Telex* in a room in Italy full of thousands and thousands of Radiohead fans from all over Europe, and the world. *Planet Telex* was followed by *2 + 2 = 5*, which got me even more hyped. If you know anything about my love for Radiohead, you'll know *Hail to the Thief* is my favorite album from them, and hearing a whole room of people screaming "payin' attention" to the album's opening anthem was an experience like I've never had before. *2 + 2 = 5* was followed by *Sit Down. Stand Up.*, because there's really no other way to follow it. I decided to be a bit of a funny guy and follow Thom's instructions literally, sitting down and standing up in my seat as he ordered. (There was nobody behind me to piss off, being in the back row.) Since being at the first Radiohead tour in seven years wasn't enough entertainment, my buddy and I also made bingo cards, for which we each picked twenty five songs, randomized the order, and tried to see who would get a bingo first. He ended up winning, getting five straight across the bottom with *Videotape*, *Kid A*, *Everything in its Right Place*, *The National Anthem*, and *Just*. I had four "almost-bingos," where them playing *Lift*, *Idioteque*, *Man of War*, or *Jigsaw Falling into Place* would have gotten me a bingo. Good fun.

The whole show was amazing, but some highlights were the tour debuts of *Kid A* and *Talk Show Host*, *Hail to the Thief's* heavy hitters *The Gloaming*, *There, There*, and *A Wolf at the Door*, tearjerkers *How to Disappear Completely*, *Videotape*, and *Fake Plastic Trees*, TikTok's favorites *Let Down* and *No Surprises*, and Thom's "it's fine, they didn't notice" during *Paranoid Android.* Picking my favorite moments is hard though, as there weren't any songs that I "wasn't feeling" or didn't know, it was an amazing setlist. Sure, there are more songs that they didn't play that I would have liked to have heard, but they can only play twenty five songs in a night, and I like a lot more than twenty five of their songs. The full setlist was as follows:

1. Planet Telex
2. 2 + 2 = 5
3. Sit Down. Stand Up.
4. Bloom
5. Lucky
6. 15 Step
7. The Gloaming
8. Kid A
9. No Surprises
10. Videotape
11. Weird Fishes / Arpeggi
12. Everything in its Right Place (with *Harry Patch (In Memory Of)* intro)
13. Talk Show Host
14. The National Anthem
15. Daydreaming
16. How to Disappear Completely
17. Bodysnatchers
18. There, There
19. Fake Plastic Trees
20. Let Down
21. Paranoid Android
22. You and Whose Army?
23. A Wolf at the Door
24. Just
25. Karma Police

The show was truly something amazing, a feeling like I had never felt before in my life. Sure, I had been to concerts, but much smaller gigs, a *Parni Valjak* gig at ŠTUK in Maribor, and a *Prljavo Kazalište* gig at Tvornica Kulture in Zagreb. After the show ended, I was on such a high for days. I rewatched the recordings I did have over and over again, and kicked myself for not recording the songs I didn't. I'm so grateful I had the opportunity to go to Radiohead not just once, but twice within a month, just a few months after believing I would never get to hear them live, and lamenting that Thom was only touring in Oceania and East Asia.

Leaving the show was less amazing. Unipol Arena is outside of the city, and public transport from the Arena stops around 11. Given that the show ended at about 10:30, and I went to queue up for the merch stand after, the next bus available back to Bologna's city center was at 5 AM. But our bus back to Zagreb was at 4 AM. After trying for forty five minutes to call a taxi through Uber and local taxi apps and having no luck, a random Italian man walked out of the shadows and came up to us, and asked us if we needed a ride to the center. Initially sussed out, I decided just to go with it since we were both significantly bigger than him if he wanted to try something, and I was so ridiculously desperate. He drove us to the center for way less than the apps were charging, and he was a really nice guy too, just lived in the area and knew a lot of people would be there, and that there wasn't reliable transport back. Truly a godsend that this man came up to the two of us out of the hundred-odd people waiting.

Thank you Thom, Jonny, Colin, Ed, Phil, Chris, and all the other people who made this show possible. I can't wait to see what's next for Thom Yorke & the Radio Heads.
